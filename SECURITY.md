# ðŸ”’ AMPLIFI SECURITY DOCUMENTATION

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Strict CSP headers prevent XSS attacks
- Only allows trusted sources for scripts, styles, and media
- Blocks inline scripts except where necessary for functionality

### 2. Security Headers
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking attacks  
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Enables browser XSS filtering
- **Strict-Transport-Security**: Enforces HTTPS connections
- **Referrer-Policy**: Controls referrer information

### 3. Input Validation & Sanitization
- All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- HTML content is escaped to prevent XSS
- File uploads are strictly validated (type, size, extension)
- Rate limiting prevents abuse

### 4. Authentication Security
- Firebase Authentication with secure token handling
- Password requirements: 8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, number
- Username validation prevents injection attacks
- Session management handled by Firebase

### 5. Data Protection
- No sensitive credentials in client-side code
- Only public Firebase API keys exposed (safe for client-side)
- Secure file upload validation
- Local storage data is non-sensitive only

### 6. Network Security
- All external resources loaded over HTTPS
- CDN fallbacks for critical resources
- Service worker implements additional security headers

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers:
1. Never commit sensitive files (keys, tokens, credentials)
2. Always validate and sanitize user input
3. Use SecurityUtils.sanitizeHTML() for dynamic content
4. Use InputValidator for form validation
5. Implement rate limiting for sensitive operations

### For Users:
1. Use strong, unique passwords
2. Keep browsers updated
3. Be cautious with file uploads
4. Report suspicious activity

## Incident Response
1. Monitor Firebase Console for unusual activity
2. Check GitHub security alerts regularly
3. Update dependencies when security patches available
4. Review access logs periodically

## Security Contacts
- Report vulnerabilities through GitHub Issues
- Tag issues with 'security' label for priority handling

## Compliance
- GDPR: User data protection and right to deletion
- COPPA: No data collection from users under 13
- CCPA: California user privacy rights
